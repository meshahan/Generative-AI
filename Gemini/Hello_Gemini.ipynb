            "\n",
            "Common causes of chronic back pain include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Poor posture:**  Slouching, prolonged sitting, and improper lifting techniques strain back muscles and ligaments.\n",
            "* **Muscle strains and sprains:** Overexertion, sudden movements, or weak core muscles can lead to injuries.\n",
            "* **Degenerative disc disease:**  The discs between vertebrae lose their cushioning ability with age, leading to pain.\n",
            "* **Spinal stenosis:** Narrowing of the spinal canal puts pressure on nerves.\n",
            "* **Osteoarthritis:**  Wear and tear of the facet joints in the spine.\n",
            "* **Scoliosis:**  A sideways curvature of the spine.\n",
            "* **Herniated disc:** A ruptured disc puts pressure on nerves.\n",

            "\n",
            "Prevention strategies include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Maintaining good posture:**  Sit and stand tall, use ergonomic chairs and workstations.\n",
            "* **Strengthening core muscles:**  Exercises like planks, bridges, and Pilates improve stability.\n",
            "* **Proper lifting techniques:**  Lift with your legs, keeping your back straight.\n",
            "* **Maintaining a healthy weight:**  Excess weight puts extra strain on the back.\n",
            "* **Regular exercise:**  Improves flexibility, strength, and overall health.\n",
            "* **Avoiding smoking:**  Smoking reduces blood flow to the spine, hindering healing.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Osteoarthritis (OA):** A degenerative joint disease caused by the breakdown of cartilage. It's often age-related and affects weight-bearing joints.  It's a localized, non-inflammatory condition.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):** An autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks the joints, causing inflammation and damage. It can affect multiple joints symmetrically. It's a systemic, inflammatory condition.\n",

            "\n",
            "Treatment differences:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **OA:** Treatment focuses on pain management and slowing progression. This includes over-the-counter pain relievers (like ibuprofen or acetaminophen), topical creams, physical therapy, weight loss (if overweight), joint injections (cortisone), and in severe cases, joint replacement surgery.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **RA:** Treatment aims to control inflammation and prevent joint damage. This involves disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to suppress the immune system, NSAIDs for pain and inflammation, corticosteroids (for severe flares), biologics (targeted therapies), and physical therapy.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Treatment depends on the severity of the tear and the individual's activity level. Options include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Non-surgical treatment:**  This involves RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation), physical therapy to strengthen the surrounding muscles, and bracing.  Suitable for minor tears and individuals with low activity levels.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Surgical treatment (ACL reconstruction):**  This involves replacing the torn ligament with a graft from another tendon in the body.  This is usually necessary for significant tears, especially in athletes or individuals with high activity levels.  Post-surgery, extensive physical therapy is crucial for rehabilitation.\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",

            "* **Blood clots:**  Can lead to pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung).\n",
            "* **Dislocation:**  The artificial joint can become dislocated.\n",
            "* **Nerve damage:**  Can cause numbness or weakness.\n",
            "* **Fracture:**  Of the bone around the implant.\n",
