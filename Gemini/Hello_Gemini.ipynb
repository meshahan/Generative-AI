            "Common causes of chronic back pain include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Poor posture:**  Slouching, prolonged sitting, and improper lifting techniques strain back muscles and ligaments.\n",
            "* **Muscle strains and sprains:** Overexertion, sudden movements, or weak core muscles can lead to injuries.\n",
            "* **Disc problems:** Degenerative disc disease, herniated discs, and bulging discs can compress nerves, causing pain.\n",
            "* **Osteoarthritis:**  Degeneration of the cartilage in the spine.\n",
            "* **Spinal stenosis:** Narrowing of the spinal canal, putting pressure on nerves.\n",

            "* **Maintaining good posture:**  Sit and stand tall, supporting your lower back.\n",
            "* **Strengthening core muscles:**  Exercises like planks, bridges, and crunches stabilize the spine.\n",
            "* **Proper lifting techniques:** Bend your knees, keep your back straight, and lift with your legs.\n",
            "* **Maintaining a healthy weight:** Excess weight puts extra stress on the back.\n",
            "* **Regular exercise:**  Improves flexibility, strength, and overall fitness.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **RA:** Treatment aims to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. This involves disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologics (targeted therapies), NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and physical therapy.  Surgery may be necessary in severe cases to repair damaged joints.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Non-surgical treatment:**  This involves RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation), physical therapy to strengthen the surrounding muscles, and bracing.  Suitable for minor tears and individuals with low activity levels.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Surgical treatment (ACL reconstruction):**  This involves replacing the torn ligament with a graft from another tendon in the body.  This is usually necessary for significant tears and athletes or individuals with high activity levels.  Post-surgery, extensive physical therapy is crucial for recovery.\n",
